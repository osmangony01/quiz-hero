            <div class="panel">
                <p><b>Ans:</b> </p>
                <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. </p>
                <p>The Event Loop is an infinite loop that keeps waiting for a queue (sometimes referred to as the Callback Queue or Event Queue) to be filled with tasks. As and when the callback queue gets filled up with a task, the Event Loop kicks in and removes the task based on FIFO (First In First Out) from the Callback Queue. It is then pushed on to the Call Stack which executes the task.</p>

                <p>Here, when quiz-loaded then the quizTimer() function call. The quizTimer() function take one parameter. Initially, we cannot pass a parameter value, so parameter value undefined. So, Inside quizTimer() function, firstly if condition is checking according to parameter value and whether if condition is true then if-block is working and timer is stop, otherwise timer is running and counting seconds. When we submit the quiz the timer is stop  because we call quizTimer() function with true parameter.</p>

This function basically add the givenAns property of given-answer value and with quiz-data in answers array. Here answers array is like of quiz-data but difference is quiz-data array has no givenAns property whereas answers array has givenAns property.Finally the chooseQuiz() function call displayAnswer() function which show the highlighted answer and which you give quiz answer before.</p>
